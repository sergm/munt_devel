mt32emu_win32_installer - NSIS scripts used in munt Windows installer package

MIDI_stuff - drivers and utilites which can appear useful for specific MIDI-related tasks

mt32emu_analog_tester - a tester for the emulation class of MT-32 analog output circuits

mt32emu_midi_parser_tester - a tester for MidiStreamParser abstract class of libmt32emu

mt32emu_SampleRateConverter_tester - a tester for SampleRateConverter subclasses of mt32emu_qt
