MT32Emu WinMM Driver for Windows 9x
===================================

Windows driver that provides for creating MIDI output port and transferring MIDI messages
to mt32emu_qt, the main UI-enabled synthesiser application. Due to limitations of the multimedia
subsystem of this platform, this driver requires the main application mt32emu_qt to be running.


Building
========

For building, Windows Millenium DDK can be used which provides 16-bit C compiler
and other required header files, libraries and tools.
